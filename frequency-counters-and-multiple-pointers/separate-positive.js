// Write a function called separatePositive which accepts an array of non-zero integers.
// Separate the positive integers to the left and the negative integers to the right.
// The positive numbers and negative numbers need not be in sorted order.
// The problem should be done in place (in other words, do not build a copy of the input array).
function separatePositive(integers) {}
